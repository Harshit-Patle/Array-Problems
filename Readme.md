# Array Problems

A curated list of common problems to practice working with arrays.

### Basic Operations

1.  **Find the sum of all elements in an array.**
    - Calculate the total sum of all numbers in a given array.

2.  **Find the average of array elements.**
    - Compute the average value of all the elements in an array.

3.  **Find the maximum/minimum element in an array.**
    - Identify the largest and smallest numbers within an array.

4.  **Search for a given element (linear search).**
    - Find if a specific element exists in an array by checking each element one by one.

5.  **Count the occurrences of a specific element.**
    - Determine how many times a particular value appears in an array.

6.  **Replace all occurrences of a specific element with another number.**
    - Substitute every instance of a given element with a new value.

7.  **Check if an array contains a given number.**
    - Verify the presence of a specific number in an array.

8.  **Count how many elements are even and how many are odd.**
    - Tally the total count of even and odd numbers in an array.

9.  **Separate even and odd elements into two arrays.**
    - Create two new arrays, one containing all even numbers and the other all odd numbers from the original array.

10. **Copy elements from one array to another.**
    - Duplicate the contents of one array into a new array.

11. **Merge two arrays into a third array.**
    - Combine the elements of two separate arrays into a single new array.

12. **Compare two arrays for equality.**
    - Check if two arrays have the same elements in the same order.

### Indexing and Positioning

13. **Find the index of the first occurrence of a given element.**
    - Locate the position (index) of the first time a specific element appears.

14. **Find the index of the last occurrence of a given element.**
    - Locate the position (index) of the last time a specific element appears.

15. **Shift all elements to the left by one position.**
    - Move every element in the array one spot to the left, with the first element typically wrapping around to the end or being discarded.

16. **Shift all elements to the right by one position.**
    - Move every element in the array one spot to the right, with the last element typically wrapping around to the beginning or being discarded.

17. **Rotate an array by k positions to the right.**
    - Shift the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of `k` positions.

18. **Rotate an array by k positions to the left.**
    - Shift the elements of an array to the left by a specified number of `k` positions.

19. **Move all zeroes to the end without changing the order of other elements.**
    - Rearrange the array so that all zero elements are moved to the end, while preserving the relative order of the non-zero elements.

### Sorting and Ordering

20. **Sort an array in ascending order.**
    - Arrange the elements of an array from the smallest to the largest value.

21. **Sort an array in descending order.**
    - Arrange the elements of an array from the largest to the smallest value.

22. **Find the second largest element in an array.**
    - Identify the element that is the second-largest in value.

23. **Find the second smallest element in an array.**
    - Identify the element that is the second-smallest in value.

24. **Find the largest three elements in an array.**
    - Find the top three largest numbers in the array.

25. **Find the smallest three elements in an array.**
    - Find the top three smallest numbers in the array.

26. **Check if an array is sorted (ascending).**
    - Determine if the elements in an array are already in ascending order.

27. **Rearrange array so that positive and negative numbers alternate.**
    - Reorder the array such that positive and negative numbers appear in an alternating pattern.

### Duplicates and Frequency

28. **Remove duplicates from an array.**
    - Create a new array containing only the unique elements from the original array.

29. **Count the frequency of each element.**
    - Tally how many times each unique element appears in the array.

30. **Find the majority element (element occurring more than n/2 times).**
    - Find the element that appears more than half the number of times of the array's length.

31. **Find the intersection of two arrays.**
    - Identify the common elements present in both arrays.

32. **Find the union of two arrays.**
    - Create a new array containing all unique elements from both arrays.

33. **Find the duplicate number in an array (with one duplicate).**
    - In an array of n+1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n, find the one that is repeated.

34. **Find the element that appears only once while others appear twice.**
    - Identify the single element in an array that does not have a duplicate.

### Array Manipulation and Analysis

35. **Reverse an array in place without using extra space.**
    - Reverse the order of elements in the array without creating a new array.

36. **Find the sum of even and sum of odd elements separately.**
    - Calculate two sums: one for all even numbers and one for all odd numbers.

37. **Replace negative numbers with zero.**
    - Change all negative values in the array to 0.

38. **Replace all zeroes with ones.**
    - Change all zero values in the array to 1.

39. **Find the difference between the largest and smallest element.**
    - Calculate the range of values in the array.

40. **Find all pairs of elements whose sum is equal to a given number.**
    - Identify all pairs of numbers in the array that add up to a specific target value.

41. **Count the number of elements greater than a given number.**
    - Tally how many elements in the array are larger than a specified value.

42. **Find the missing number in a sequence from 1 to n.**
    - In an array containing n-1 numbers from a sequence of 1 to n, find the one that is missing.
